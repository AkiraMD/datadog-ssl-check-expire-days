This is a cool way to check the expire date for all your SSL sites. Now instead of adding calendar events, you can just do monitoring with alerting

The original source is https://workshop.avatarnewyork.com/project/datadog-ssl-expires-check/ and I just changed the way it works.
On the original source, it checked for certificates in the file system. On my version, the script checks for web site certificates.

For information on how to set it up, go to the original author's web site. Only difference is in the yaml file.

I love datadog :)
